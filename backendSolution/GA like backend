In order to design a GA(Google Analytics) like backend, we need to understand what the service does:

Google Analytics is a service monitoring the audience of websites or applications. Statistics, user analysis and
Machine Learning are parts of the services Google Analytics is able to provide.

This definition gives us a good part of the necessary information on how the data flow should be designed in order to
provide a service alike GA.

1) We need a reliable way to gather the user information like preferences or visit frequency. We also need to be able
   to scale on the potential huge amount of users AND clients using our service.

2) We need to redirect the user's requests to the service they want to reach after going through our process and
   redirect the answer back. We also need a service discovery for new clients that would potentially subscribe to our
   service.

3) We need to send the gathered data through our processes and micro-services(micro-services would allow our backend
   to offer personalized services easier while being easier to maintain and reusable). Therefore, we need a queue
   system.

4) We then need to process the data through our micro-services and queues while directing them to the right storage
   solution.

5) We need to find a reliable storage solution to make the processed data accessible to our clients on demand.

6) We need to load balance and forward our client's request to micro-services that will fetch the required data and
   present them. The solution might be the same as the one on the user side since we can assume that the requirements
   are the same.


Therefore our architecture will be composed as 6 different steps/services that can handle huge load of data in a minimum
response time and a maximum reliability while trying to reduce the costs as much as possible. I would suggest to use
the same provider as much as possible since we can have offer on the amount of services we subscribe to.
